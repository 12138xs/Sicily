# Sicily
![Sicily](https://github.com/Nightonke/Sicily/blob/master/Pic/Sicily.png)

### What's this?

I told to myself to keep solving an ACM problem every day when I'm a fresh-man in SYSU. You know, I've never been brought to programming before my college life. And I did keep this self-promise in my first 2 year. To this day, there are 672 problems' solutions here for [Sicily](http://soj.sysu.edu.cn)(now you have to use inner-internet in SYSU or vpn to browse it). **But notice: Must think and code before reading the solutions.** I hope these solutions can help somebody who is struggling in but also love ACM.

And I'm coding in [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/) too. I have solved 235 problems so far and I'm updating my solutions in repository [LeetCode](https://github.com/Nightonke/LeetCode) in my free time.

So now, stop fucking degenerating and start coding.

### How to Search a Solution?

There are 940 .cpp file in Sicily directory. For each file, it's name is XXXXX_YY.cpp, where XXXXX is the id for the corresponding problem in Sicily and YY is the time that I submitted(start from 0). For example, [01000_06.cpp](https://github.com/Nightonke/Sicily/blob/master/Sicily/01000_06.cpp) is the 7th submission for problem [1000](http://soj.sysu.edu.cn/1000).

### No Just Codes

I've writed some articles in my [blog](http://blog.csdn.net/u012925008) for some problems. Maybe you can get more information about the solutions there.
